# Backend Architecture

The backend is a REST API written in Python using the Flask framework. It is responsible for handling all requests from the frontend and communicating with the database. The backend is hosted on Heroku and the database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The backend is also responsible for sending emails to users when they sign up and when they request a password reset.
